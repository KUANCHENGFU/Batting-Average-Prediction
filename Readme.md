# Batting Average Prediction

## Overview
This project aimed at using players' batting averages from the first half of the season to predict their batting averages for the second half of the season. This project is basically composed of four parts as follows:
1. Develop a Bayesian beta-binomial model to esitmate players' batting averages
2. Construct a Bayesian hierarchical normal model to esitmate players' batting averages
3. Compare the MSEs of the above two models
4. Perform the above three steps for the data of non-pitchers and pitchers separately
